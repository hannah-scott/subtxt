# subtxt

A `sh` twtxt client

## Usage

1. Set up some people to follow: the format is `nick[TAB]url`, e.g.

```txt
example	https://example.com/file.txt
test	https://test.com/twtxt.txt
person	file:///home/user/path/to/blog.txt
```

2. Edit config values in `subtxt.sh`
3. Run `./subtxt.sh` - pipe it to `head` or a pager if your terminal is hell
